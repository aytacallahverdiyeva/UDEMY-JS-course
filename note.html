<!-- ? Javascript -- is a high-level object oriented multi-paradigm programming language. Instruct computer to do something.We dont have to worry about complex stuff like memory management. Based on objects, for storing most kinds of data. Multi paradigm means that we can use different styles of programming.  -->

<!-- ? The console is just an environment that was built to execute small pieces of code and then show results immediately -->

<!-- * Values and variables -->

<!-- ? Value is basically a piece of data. So a value is basically the smallest unit of information that we have in JS. We can store them into variables. And so this way we can reuse them over and over again.  -->

<!-- ? For naming variables (camelcase - firstPerson; with _ - first_person) -->
<!-- ? We can't use "new" word as variable name because new is a reserved keyword in JS. And the same goes for something like "function". -->

<!-- ? We have a convention of writing PI because it is always equals 3.145 , it's const. -->
<!-- ? let PI = 3.145; -->
