<!-- ? Javascript -- is a high-level object oriented multi-paradigm programming language. Instruct computer to do something.We dont have to worry about complex stuff like memory management. Based on objects, for storing most kinds of data. Multi paradigm means that we can use different styles of programming.  -->

<!-- ? The console is just an environment that was built to execute small pieces of code and then show results immediately -->

<!-- & Values and variables -->

<!-- ? Value is basically a piece of data. So a value is basically the smallest unit of information that we have in JS. We can store them into variables. And so this way we can reuse them over and over again.  -->

<!-- ? For naming variables (camelcase - firstPerson; with _ - first_person) -->
<!-- ? We can't use "new" word as variable name because new is a reserved keyword in JS. And the same goes for something like "function". -->

<!-- ? We have a convention of writing PI because it is always equals 3.145 , it's const. -->
<!-- ? let PI = 3.145; -->

<!-- & Data Types -->

<!-- ? In every programming language values can have different types, depending on the type of data that we want them to hold. In JS every value is either an object or a primitive value. -->

<!-- ? There are 7 primitive data types. Number, string, boolean, undefined, null, symbol, bigint. -->

<!-- * 1.Number. Floating point numbers, used for decimals and integers: let age = 22; -->
<!-- * 2.String. Sequence of characters, used for text: let firstName = 'Aytac'; -->
<!-- * 3.Boolean. Logical type that can be true or false, used for taking decisions: let fullAge = true; -->
<!-- * 4.Undefined. Value taken by a variable that is not yet defined (empty value): let children; -->
<!-- * 5.Null. Also means 'empty value' -->
<!-- * 6.Symbol(ES2015). Value that is unique and cannot be changed [Not useful for now] -->
<!-- * 7.Bigint(ES2020). Larger integers than the number type can hold -->

<!-- ? JS has dynamic typing: We dont have to manually define the data type of the value stored in variable. Instead data types are determined automatically. -->
